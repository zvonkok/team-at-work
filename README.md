Although humans and robots do work as ateam today, they are kept strictly
apart from one another for safety reasons. However, this does not have to be the
case. Using the "team@work" experimental facility, the Fraunhofer IPA and IPK are able to demonstrate 
how direct cooperation between humans and robost can be organized. The closely coordinated cooperation enhances productivityand flexibility - especially in low-volume batch prodcution of highly variable product lines.
